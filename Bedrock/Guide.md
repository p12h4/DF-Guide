### Notes:
- To switch versions on Windows, you can use [MCLauncher](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Files/MCLauncher.zip) from the `Resources` folder. However, for most early versions, you'll need to do it on a mobile device.

- To access coordinates in older versions of Minecraft, you can use the [CoordinatesUnlocker](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Resource%20Packs/CoordinatesUnlocker.mcpack) Resource Pack from the `Resources` folder. This pack is made for older versions that automatically enabled cheats when coordinates were activated.

- Loading a world creates a "players" folder in the world files. 

- Any beetroot crops that are placed, will convert to info_update2 in the next version. These blocks can be mined with any tool and will drop themselves

- Items can be overstacked by opening your world to LAN and connecting with a second device. If a second device isn’t available, you can use apps like [Parallel Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lbe.parallel.intl) to run multiple minecraft instances. Drop the items to the second device and relog on the host device after 10 seconds. This process makes item stacks go over 99, and sometimes over 255, which causes them to overflow into a negative value. In the game, though, negative stacks will still show as 99+

- Cacti can grow adjacent to other blocks

- Carpets can be crafted with wool, which is required for the next version
<br>


### 0.8.0_test1: (Android Exclusive Version)

<br>


### 1.12.0:
> [!NOTE]
> This discontinued feature can only be seen by using third-party tools or checking the files in the world folder.

You can keep such items by storing them in a shulker box and then destroying the box. Placing the box back down would also automatically reset their damage values to 0

> [!NOTE]
> This discontinued feature can only be seen by using third-party tools or checking the files in the world folder.
- Breaking leaves with silk touch will drop leaves that don't stack with each other. These can have a "update_bit" tag, "persistant_bit" tag, or both.

<br>


### Beta 1.16.100.56:
- Eggs with Efficiency 1 can be found in a secret room within Woodland Mansions. The room contains a chest and a tree, with its entrance blocked off but the frame still visible. This room always appears only on the mansion's first floor. Throughout this guide, this room will now be referred to as the "tree room". You can use the ["Mansion X-Ray"](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Resource%20Packs/Mansion%20X-Ray.mcpack) Resource Pack from the `Resources` folder to make finding hidden rooms easier
<br>


### 1.16.100:
- If you place a gateway block on the pillar of the end fountain and the dragon perches on the fountain, the dragon will be frozen. Upon re-entering the end, an end gateway will appear where the dragon was, and the dragon will be free again as long as it doesn't perch into the gateway again. These end gateways teleport you to the spot where you manually placed the gateway block

- Placing a sign against a block would replace that block with the sign, making it possible to delete blocks. For example, having a slab on the lower half and placing a sign on it will delete the block directly above the slab. This can also be used to make signs that are supported solely by other signs
<br>


### 1.16.201:
- Pushing End Crystals with a flying machine while summoning an ender dragon, will prevent them from updating. As a result, they will remain indestructible and permanently display the summoning beam

<br>


### Beta 1.16.220.51: (Android Exclusive Version, Requires "Caves and Cliffs" World Toggle)

- Walls connect to Powder Snow 
<br>

> [!NOTE]
> This discontinued feature can only be observed once by placing it down, destroying the discontinued feature.
- Leashing Axolotls before scooping them up with a bucket won't unleash the axolotl

- Snow layers stay floating in mid-air if the block underneath is broken
<br>


### 1.17.32:
> [!CAUTION]
> (1.17.30-1.17.40): A change in the game caused a bug where certain creatures, like the Ender Dragon, weren't being properly removed from the "autonomous entities" list. For example, if you would enter the end but not slay the dragon, it would be in this list. Then if you save and relog, the list would multiply by 2 everytime. Over time, this would use up a lot of memory and eventually cause the game to crash if too many dragons were added.

- Support Blocks can be placed onto Light Blocks
<br>


### 1.17.40:
- Pushing a button and quickly breaking it with a silk touch tool will drop a pushed button. Stacking pushed buttons with regular buttons will revert them

- Updating any world to this version will not generate anything below y level 0 if there is no bedrock at y level 0

- Placing walls underneath floating candles will make the walls fully strech

- Pushing piglins through a nether portal while they are trying to barter with the player will force them to put the item that was given to them into their offhand, making them dual wielding mobs

- Pushing a villager through a nether portal while it is holding something will make the villager permanently hold the item. Do not hold an item that the villager wants once it is permanently holding an item or else it will stop holding it

- Scaffolding at y level 1 will not update and fall if there is no block below it

- Librarians only require a single Book and Quill instead of two

- Some igloos can generate with Redstone Torches facing the wrong way. Example: Seed: 1235243567, Coordinates: 115 79 547

- Mountain generation breaks at 2.812.332 blocks away from 0, 0 and replaces everything within a Frozen Peaks or Stony Peaks biome, except Aquifers, with huge lava ravines. These Aquifers can stretch all the way down to bedrock and be on top of the lava without updating it and turning it into Obsidian. An example can be found on the Seed: -1485667881, at 2891297 -49 9439. On certain iOS devices, Monolith-like terrain generates instead of Lava Ravines. These "Monoliths" can go up to the old world height limit, y level 256
<br>


### 1.18.10:
- The third hotbar slot acts as another output slot while being in the Furnace UI. For instance, if you switch between two stacks of netherite scraps (rename one to be able to swap) in this slot, you will receive 128 XP per swap. By using an autoclicker, you can reach the maximum level using this bug. You can use auto-clickers for both [Windows](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Files/AutoClicker/Windows/AutoClicker-3.0.exe) and [Android](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Files/AutoClicker/Android/OPAutoClicker.apk) from the `Resources` folder

- It is possible to obtain villagers with incorrect trades, such as a fletcher with stone mason trades. A video showing how to do it can be seen [here](https://github.com/p12h4/DF-Guide/raw/refs/heads/main/Bedrock/Resources/Media/Villagers%20with%20trades%20from%20the%20wrong%20profession.mp4)

- Downgrading a cartographer with the globe pattern trade from this version to 1.18.10.21 turns the trade into an empty trade

- Making a Banner with the Globe Pattern and downgrading to 1.18.10.21 turns the globe banner pattern on the banner into "item.banner.base.x", where "x" represents the color. Globe banners will keep the globe banner tag, which means they will revert to normal banners when upgrading back. To avoid this, simply place the banners down and break them. This will remove the globe banner tag and preserve the "item.banner.base.x" tag
<br>


### Beta 1.18.20.21: (Requires "Wild Update" World Toggle)
> [!NOTE]
> This discontinued feature can only be seen by using third-party tools or checking the files in the world folder.

> World sizes may fluctuate. They can randomly increase exponentially, resulting in worlds with gigabytes of junk data
- All types of Torches, redstone dust, Glow Lichen and Walls can be placed or attached to Bells

- Place blocks in the lowest subchunk of a dimension in the east or west quadrants. After placing the blocks, relog or switch dimensions, then return and break all the blocks in that subchunk. Relog or switch dimensions again, and the blocks will reappear in a glitched form. This glitch allows for unique creations like half-beds, invisible shulker boxes with unique properties, and headless pistons. It can also create different types of wall skulls depending on placement and orientation. Placing a skull on the ground gives a Wither Skeleton Wall Skull, while placing them on walls results in different skulls. West gives a Creeper Wall Skull, south gives a Steve Wall Skull, north gives a Zombie Wall Skull, and east gives a Dragon Wall Skull
<br>


### Beta 1.18.30.28: (Android Exclusive Version)
